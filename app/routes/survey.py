# This route actually does two things depending on the state of the if statement 
# 'if form.validate_on_submit()'. When the route is first called, the form has not 
# been submitted yet so the if statement is False and the route renders the form.
# If the user has filled out and succesfully submited the form then the if statement
# is True and this route creates the new blog based on what the user put in the form.
# Because this route includes a form that both gets and blogs data it needs the 'methods'
# in the route decorator.

        # to send them to that blog. url_for takes as its argument the function name
